### Science of the star in our backyard: Introduction and data analyis 

This is a workshop organized by IUCAA at Wayanad, Kerala on the Occasion of Annular Solar Eclipse 2019. 
The workshop covers a range of topics from Solar dynamo to Spaceweather, supplemented by data processing techniques. 
More information on this may be found here: https://www.iucaa.in/ws/~SSBDA2019/

Dr. Sreejith (Post-doc at IUCAA), Abhishek Rajhans and Yours Truly are organizing a Data analysis session in Python. At the end 
of the tutorial session, it is to be expected that the students can:

1. Load a fits file, and making sense of the header and data units. 
2. Plotting an AIA image with co-temporal HMI data.
3. Grid of AIA and HMI plots.
4. Time series video of AIA and HMI plots for understanding evolution of an AR.

The students are B.Sc/B.Tech level, and are thus assumed to have very minimal knowledge of coding and plotting stuff. 

-----------------------------------------
**Setting up your system for work**: see the attached [Instructions.md](Instructions.md).

**Data download**: Can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3rojazhsh3yo4vl/AADgvFT3lYlWmy9pbl3djPO5a?dl=0). Make sure the 
data is kept as per the directory tree explained in the tutorial notebook.
